# Debounce Click Event Hook for React

### Introduction

Debouncing is a technique used to improve the performance of an application by limiting the rate at which a function is executed. In the context of click events, debouncing can help to reduce the number of API calls made in response to rapid or repetitive user interactions, such as multiple clicks on a button.

### How it Works

This hook makes it easy to debounce click events in your React components, by wrapping your event handler in a debounced function and returning it for use with the onClick prop. The hook uses the setTimeout API to wait for a specified time period after the last click before executing the handler, and it clears the timeout whenever a new click occurs, resetting the countdown.
